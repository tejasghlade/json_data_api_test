The increased demand for container shipping and inventory restocking during 2021 persisted for a longer period than initially anticipated, leading to reduced port productivity, disrupted sailing schedule, shortage of trucks, railways and warehousing capacity. Supply chain disruptions became a factor influencing demand and supply, while concerns regarding the vaccine rates, turnaround in the pandemic, renewed waves and new variants of the virus continue to pose risk for future worldwide demand. During 2022 demand declined due partially to reduction in consumption and higher interest rates, while both COVID-19 restrictions and congestion in ports have generally eased. We endeavor to adapt our vessel fleet capacity to the supply and demand trends. For example, in an attempt to meet the sharp demand increase during 2021, we have expanded our operated vessel fleet from 87 vessels as of January 1, 2021, to 150 vessels as of December 31, 2022 (including eight purchased secondhand), as well ",
